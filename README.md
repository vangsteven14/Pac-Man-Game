# Pac-Man Game

An inspired project that I modified to showcase my skills in analyzing, engineering, and extending existing code with customized design improvements as well as enhancing them with original design and functionality. <br>

**_pacman.py_**: Demonstrates the classic retro version everyone loves! <br>
**_pacman_ghost_ver.py_**: Demonstrates an alternative approach where you spawn as a ghost. <br>
**_pacman_manyGhosts_ver.py_**: Demonstrates the classic version but with more challenge. <br>
